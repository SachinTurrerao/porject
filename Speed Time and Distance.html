    <div class="problem">
        <h2>1. Meeting Point of Two People Moving Between X and Y</h2>
        <p>Two places X and Y are 200 meters apart. P moves at 20 km/h and Q moves at 30 km/h. 
        When they meet for the first time, the time taken can be calculated using relative speed. 
        Relative speed = (20 + 30) km/h = 50 km/h. 
        Time = Distance / Speed = 200 meters / (50 km/h converted to m/s) = 14.4 seconds approximately.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="problem">
        <h2>2. Speed of Person Going to Office</h2>
        <p>Speed of the person while going to the office = 9 km/h, based on the relation between the average speed of 12 km/h and the return speed being three times the going speed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="problem">
        <h2>3. Speed of Car and Percentage Reduction in Time</h2>
        <p>The percentage reduction in time in the second case is 50%, as the speed of the car during the second hour is thrice the first hour, and covering all three hours at that speed reduces the time by half.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="problem">
        <h2>4. Leopard and Tiger in Circus</h2>
        <p>When the tiger completes 100 rounds, the leopard completes 80 rounds due to the ratio of their speeds and steps covered.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="problem">
        <h2>5. Speed of Current in a Boat Journey</h2>
        <p>The speed of the current is 5 km/h based on the time taken for the boat to travel upstream and downstream.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="problem">
        <h2>6. Distance Between Home and Office</h2>
        <p>The distance between the house and the office is 12 km, calculated using the walking speeds and time differences.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="problem">
        <h2>7. Time for Raju to Cover Distance at Different Speeds</h2>
        <p>Raju will take 1 hour to cover the distance running at 18 km/h, as the time is inversely proportional to speed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="problem">
        <h2>8. Time for Two Trains to Completely Clear Each Other</h2>
        <p>The two trains will take 11 seconds to completely clear each other, calculated by combining their lengths and speeds.</p>
    </div>
