    <h1>Math Problems and Solutions</h1>
    <div class="problem">
        <h2>1. Crossing Time of Two Trains from Station X and Y</h2>
        <p>Train A leaves Station X at 5 AM and reaches Station Y at 9 AM. Train B leaves Station Y at 7 AM and reaches Station X at 10:30 AM. 
        To find the time they cross, we calculate their relative speeds and the distance between the stations.
        The trains will cross each other at around 7:56 AM.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="problem">
        <h2>2. Krishna's Total Distance Covered by Train and Foot</h2>
        <p>Krishna travels part of the journey by train at 25 km/h and the rest on foot at 4 km/h. 
        Total time for the journey is 5 hours and 48 minutes. 
        The total distance covered is 40 km (20 km by train and 20 km by foot).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="problem">
        <h2>3. Time Taken by Two Trains to Cross Each Other</h2>
        <p>The speeds of the two trains are in the ratio of 7:9. The first train takes 4 seconds to cross a pole, and the second train takes 6 seconds. 
        The time taken for the trains to cross each other completely is 10 seconds.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="problem">
        <h2>4. Catch-Up Time for Two Buses from Delhi to Karnal</h2>
        <p>The faster bus, starting at 10 AM at 25 m/s, will catch the slower bus, which started at 8 AM at 20 m/s, at 12:40 PM. 
        This is calculated based on the distance between Delhi and Karnal (200 km).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="problem">
        <h2>5. Time for a Car to Cover 630 km with Increasing Speed</h2>
        <p>The car starts at 50 km/h, with its speed increasing by 5 km/h every hour. 
        The car will take 9 hours to cover the total distance of 630 km.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="problem">
        <h2>6. Distance Covered by a Bus at Different Speeds</h2>
        <p>The bus travels at 50 km/h for 12 minutes and 40 km/h for 18 minutes. 
        The total distance covered by the bus during this time is 23 km.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="problem">
        <h2>7. Increased Time for Decreased Speed</h2>
        <p>A person takes 3Â½ hours to cover 140 km. If they decrease their speed by 5 km/h, the increase in time is 30 minutes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="problem">
        <h2>8. Number of Possible Speeds for Friend B on a Circular Track</h2>
        <p>Friends A and B run on a circular track in the same direction, with A running at 6 m/s and B running at a speed of b m/s. 
        If they cross each other exactly twice, the number of possible values of b, given that b is a natural number less than 30, is 4.</p>
